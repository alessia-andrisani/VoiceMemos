# VoiceMemos


In this project I tried to replicate `VoiceMemos` in order to learn how to use CoreData in `SwiftUI`. 
The project has been developed in SwiftUI for iPhone and the technolgies used include `CoreData` to store the information about the recordings and `AVFoundation framework` to play the sounds when starting or stopping a recording.
