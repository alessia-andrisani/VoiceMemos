# VoiceMemos-Vin-Brule


In this project I tried to replicate VoiceMemos in order to learn how to use CoreData in SwiftUI. 
The project has been developed in SwiftUI for iPhone and the technolgies used include CoreData to store the information about the recordings and AVFoundation to play the sounds when starting or stopping a recording.
